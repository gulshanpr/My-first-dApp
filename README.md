#How I ran this project?
- I started a live server from VS code of `index.html`
- I have installed a Wallet called `Metamask` and loaded some Testnets
- Then I typed my desired `mood` into the input box and clicked `set mood`
- `Metamask` extension redirected me to the Payment page using Testnets I approved the transaction.
- To check my transaction, I copied the transaction id and pasted on `Etherscan`
- When it shows success, click Get mood 
- If it shows the mood you set, I'm done.
